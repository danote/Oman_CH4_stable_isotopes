# Notes about data acquisition and processing

This R markdown file performs calibrations for dissolved inorganic carbon ($\sum\text{CO}_2$) concentration ($c$) and isotopic composition ($\delta^{13}\text{C}$) analyzed by acidification of water samples and transfer of resultant $\text{CO}_2$ via a Thermo GasBench to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Peak amplitudes are fit by exponential decay to check for proper functioning of the GasBench needle. Only peaks derived from good injections are selected. Exponential fits are then performed on all analyses to project back to the m/z 44 amplitude that would have resulted from an injection occuring at the moment of needle puncture. Expected pCO$_2$ of standards is then calculated from the mass of CaCO$_3$ loaded into vials as well as the volumes of the vial, liquid, and H$_3$PO$_4$ added. A calibration curve is constructed by plotting expected pCO$_2$ of standards vs. their m/z 44 amplitude at t$_0$. $\sum\text{CO}_2$ of the original water sample is calculated based on this calibration. 
$\delta^{13}$C is corrected for drift, linearity, and isotopic discrimination.

## Chromatograms

Display chromatograms of all samples and standards. The first four peaks are reference peaks. The smaller sharp peak after that is a half-inject used to clear the sample loop.

```{r chroms}
chroms <- iso_files %>% 
  iso_plot_continuous_flow_data(
    data = c(44),
    color = NULL
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

    ~compound,          ~ref_nr,    ~`rt`,
    # peak map data (row-by-row)

```

## Fetch peak table
```{r peak-table}
# identify peaks
peak_table_w_ids <- iso_files %>% 
  iso_map_peaks(peak_maps) %>%
  # peak table
  iso_get_peak_table(include_file_info = everything())
```


Display an example chromatogram with peaks labeled.
```{r chrom-labeled, fig.height=5}
chrom_labeled <- iso_files %>%
  iso_filter_files(Analysis == 10231) %>% 
  iso_plot_continuous_flow_data(
    # select data and aesthetics
    data = c(44),
    color = id1,
    # provide our peak table with ids
    peak_table = peak_table_w_ids, 
    # define peak labels, this can be any valid expression
    peak_label = iso_format(id = peak_info)
  ) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )

chrom_labeled
```

## Select analyte peaks
```{r select-analyte-peaks}
# focus on analyte peaks
peak_table_analytes <- peak_table_w_ids %>% 
  # omit reference peaks and half inject for further processing (i.e. analyte peaks only)
  filter(compound == "CO2 analyte")

# print
peak_table_analytes
```

# Concentration calibrations

## Quality control of peaks

Add columns to data frame for the period of time between the GasBench needle puncturing the vial and it being injected to the GC-IRMS.
```{r mutate-transfer-t}
sample_transfer_t_s <- 37 # seconds between needle stabbing vial and start of acquisition

rt_CO2_s <- 150 # actual CO2 retention time from start of inject to m/z 44 peak on mass spec

peak_table_analytes <- peak_table_analytes %>% mutate(t_stab_to_inject_s = rt - rt_CO2_s + sample_transfer_t_s) # make column for time between stabbing of gasbench needle and injection
```

Find and plot a model chromatogram with good injection.
```{r chrom-model-good}
iso_files %>% iso_filter_files(id1 == "151 ug YULE lin") %>% 
  iso_plot_continuous_flow_data(
    data = c("44"),
    color = file_id
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Plot the peak amplitudes of the training chromatogram vs. time from start of He dilution. A non-linear least squares model of exponential decay of m/z 44 amplitude vs. time from needle puncture to inject provides a good fit to the data. This is consistent with physical reality since the sample CO$_2$ is in a constant volume and is being diluted with a constant flow of He.

```{r chrom-training, warning=FALSE}
training_chrom <- peak_table_analytes %>% filter(id1 == "151 ug YULE lin")

training_chrom %>% 
   ggplot() +
  aes(
    x = t_stab_to_inject_s,
    y = amp44
    ) +
  geom_point() +
geom_line(data = function(df) mutate(df, amp44 = nls(amp44 ~ A*exp(-k*t_stab_to_inject_s), start = c(A = 10000, k = 0.0001), data = df) %>% predict()), alpha = 0.4)+
    scale_x_continuous(name = "time from GasBench needle puncture until injection on GC-IRMS [s]", limits = c(0, 600), expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = ("m/z 44 peak amplitude [mV]"))+
  theme_bw()
```

Make non-linear least squares model based on the 'training chromatogram'.
```{r exp-model, warning=FALSE}
exp_model <- nls(data = training_chrom, formula = amp44 ~ A*exp(-k*t_stab_to_inject_s), start = c(A = 10000, k = 0.0001)) # make and save model

summary(exp_model) # print summary of the model
```

Save exponential decay variable, k
```{r save-k}
k <- as.numeric(coef(exp_model)[2]) # save k

k # print k
```

For demonstration purposes, find and plot a model chromatogram with some bad injections.

We can see in the following chromatogram that the first few peaks don't follow the expected trend of decreasing amplitude with time. This indicates partial needle clogging, probably due to water condensation on underside of septum, causing some weak injections in this sample.
```{r chrom-model-bad}
iso_files %>% iso_filter_files(id1 == "47 ug YULE lin") %>% 
  iso_plot_continuous_flow_data(
    data = c(44),
    color = file_id
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

For demonstration purposes, now re-plot m/z 44 peak amplitude vs. period of time between the GasBench needle puncturing the vial and it being injected to the GC-IRMS, same chromatogram as above.
```{r weak-inject-chrom-ampls}
weak_inject_chrom <- peak_table_analytes %>% filter(id1 == "47 ug YULE lin")

weak_inject_chrom %>% 
   ggplot() +
  aes(
    x = t_stab_to_inject_s,
    y = amp44
    ) +
  geom_point()+
    scale_x_continuous(name = "time from GasBench needle puncture until injection on GC-IRMS [s]", limits = c(0, 600), expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = ("m/z 44 peak amplitude [mV]"))+
  theme_bw()
```

Now, plot all peaks alongside the fit which gives the largest m/z 44 peak amplitude at t$_0$. It is visibly clear which injects were affected by partial needle obstruction.
```{r weak-inject-chrom-ampls-fit}
weak_inject_chrom <- weak_inject_chrom %>% mutate(amp44_t0_per_peak = amp44 * exp(k*t_stab_to_inject_s)) # For each peak, calculate the projected amplitude at t0 in the chromatogram

weak_inject_chrom_max_amp44_t0  <- weak_inject_chrom %>% filter(amp44_t0_per_peak == max(amp44_t0_per_peak)) # select largest projected amplitude at t0 in the chromatogram
 
max_amp44_t0 <- weak_inject_chrom_max_amp44_t0$amp44_t0_per_peak # save largest projected amplitude at t0

t_max_amp44_t0 <- weak_inject_chrom_max_amp44_t0$t_stab_to_inject_s # save the time of the peak with largest projected amplitude at t0
 
weak_inject_chrom_fit_function <- function (x) max_amp44_t0*exp(-k*x) # write function to calculate amp44 as a function of t based on the projected amplitude at t0 estimated from the largest peak of the weak inject chromatogram and the k value from the good chromatogram

# plot the peak and the fit based on the point with largest project amp44 t0
weak_inject_chrom %>%
  ggplot() +
      stat_function(data = data.frame(amp44=c(1, 600)), aes(x=amp44), fun = weak_inject_chrom_fit_function, geom="line") +
  aes(
    x = t_stab_to_inject_s,
    y = amp44
    ) +
  geom_point(color="blue") +
    scale_x_continuous(name = "time from GasBench needle puncture until injection on GC-IRMS [s]", limits = c(0, 600), expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = ("m/z 44 peak amplitude [mV]"))+
  theme_bw()
```

Estimate the expected m/z 44 peak amplitudes of all peaks if proper injections occured based on the maximum projected amplitude at t$_0$ for each analysis. 
```{r "estimate_ampl_t0", warning=FALSE}
peak_table_analytes_max_peaks <- peak_table_analytes %>% mutate(amp44_t0_per_peak = amp44 * exp(k*t_stab_to_inject_s)) # For each peak, calculate the projected amplitude at t0 in the chromatogram

peak_table_analytes_max_peaks <- peak_table_analytes_max_peaks  %>% group_by(file_id) %>% mutate(max_amp44_t0 = max(amp44_t0_per_peak)) # add column for largest projected m/z 44 peak amplitude at t0 per peak for a given analysis

peak_table_analytes_max_peaks <- peak_table_analytes_max_peaks %>% group_by(file_id) %>% mutate(t_of_max_amp44_t0 = ifelse(amp44_t0_per_peak == max_amp44_t0, t_stab_to_inject_s, 0)) # add column for t_stab_to_inject for the peak with largest projected m/z 44 peak amplitude at t0

peak_table_analytes_max_peaks <- peak_table_analytes_max_peaks %>% group_by(file_id) %>% mutate(t_of_max_amp44_t0_copied = max(t_of_max_amp44_t0)) %>% select(-t_of_max_amp44_t0) # copy t_of_max_amp44_t0 to whole row and delete previously made column

peak_table_analytes_max_peaks <- peak_table_analytes_max_peaks %>% group_by(file_id) %>% mutate(amp44_expected = max_amp44_t0*exp(-k*t_stab_to_inject_s)) # estimate what the amp44 would have been based on the peak with largest projected m/z 44 peak amplitude at t0 and previously calculated value of k

peak_table_analytes_max_peaks <- peak_table_analytes_max_peaks %>% group_by(file_id) %>% mutate(amp44_expected_plus_1_5_percent = amp44_expected + amp44_expected*.015) # make column for expected amp44 + 1.5%

peak_table_analytes_max_peaks <- peak_table_analytes_max_peaks %>% group_by(file_id) %>% mutate(amp44_expected_minus_1_5_percent = amp44_expected - amp44_expected*.015) # make column for expected amp44 - 1.5%
```

Plot measured m/z 44 peak amplitude as well as expected peak amplitude ± 1.5%. By playing around with the interactive plot, it should be clear that normal injections are consistently within the expected value ± 1.5%, and the bad injections are obviously out of this range. 1.5% is an arbitrarily selected tuning factor.

In the following plot, it is apparent that the 'CU Sequoia' analyses do not fit the same trend of m/z 44 amplitude vs. time as the other samples. This is because 'CU Sequoia' samples are a standard gas flushed through a 12 ml Exetainer, whereas other samples are 55 ml liquid in 119 ml vials (i.e. 64 ml headspace). This illustrates that CO$_2$ dilution is faster with a smaller headspace.

```{r amp44-measured-v-expected, fig.width=15, fig.height=8}

    y = amp44,
    color = file_id
    ) +

```

### Filter out bad peaks

Filter out peaks that are not within 1.5% of the expected value for amp44
```{r filter-out-bad-injects}
peak_table_analytes_max_peaks_filtered <- peak_table_analytes_max_peaks %>% filter(amp44 > amp44_expected_minus_1_5_percent & amp44 < amp44_expected_plus_1_5_percent) # filter out peaks that are not within 1.5% of the expected value for amp44
```

Plot peaks filtered for good injections
```{r plot-good-peaks, fig.width=15, fig.height=8}
filtered_for_good_injects <- peak_table_analytes_max_peaks_filtered  %>%
   ggplot() +
  aes(
    x = t_stab_to_inject_s,
    y = amp44,
    color = file_id
    )+

# eq. 4.7.4 https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analytical_Chemistry/Book%3A_Analytical_Chemistry_2.0_(Harvey)/04_Evaluating_Analytical_Data/4.7%3A_Detection_Limits
# The ability to detect the analyte with confidence is not the same as the ability to report with confidence its concentration, or to distinguish between its concentration in two samples. For this reason the American Chemical Society’s Committee on Environmental Analytical Chemistry recommends the limit of quantitation, (SA)LOQ.

S_A_LOQ <- S_mb + 10 * sd_mb

calib_fit_summ_pCO2  <- summary(calib_fit_pCO2) # summarize regression statistics

calib_fit_summ_pCO2 # print regression statistics
```

### Calculate pCO$_2$ of samples

Filter for samples
```{r filter-for-samples}
samples <- filter(data, type_general=="sample") # filter for samples
```

### Apply calibration
```{r apply-conc-calib}
# use inverse.predict function from chemCal to predict X based on Y
samples_calibrated <- samples %>% group_by(name) %>%  mutate(pCO2_bar = as.numeric(inverse.predict(object = calib_fit_pCO2, newdata = amp44_t0, alpha = 0.05)[1]))

# use inverse.predict function from chemCal to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the prediction

samples_calibrated_summ %>% kable(digits = 6) # print
```

Now, just for demonstration purposes, convert mass CaCO$_3$ loaded to $c_{\sum\text{CO}_2}$ and re-plot. This is a simpler, more common, and slightly less exact/representative way to make such a calibration curve.
```{r plot-calib-CaCO3}
MM_CaCO3 <- 100.0869 #g/mol

linC <- linC %>% mutate(mol_CO2_total_expected = mass_loaded_ug * 1e-6 / MM_CaCO3) # add column for total moles CO2 expected

linC <- linC %>% mutate(DIC_uM = mol_CO2_total_expected / (vol_H2O_sample_ml *1e-3) * 1e6) # dissolved inorganic carbon concentration of initial water sample by dividing total moles CO2 by volume of water

  theme_bw()

```

### Calculate $c_{\sum\text{CO}_2}$ of samples
```{r calc-DIC-conc}
### for concentration

samples_calibrated_summ <- samples_calibrated_summ %>% mutate(mol_CO2_g = pCO2_bar * (vol_vial_ml - vol_l_ml) * 1e-3 / (R * lab_temp_K)) # calculate moles CO2 in gas phase

samples_calibrated_summ <- samples_calibrated_summ %>% mutate(mol_CO2_aq = mol_CO2_g * vol_l_ml*1e-3 * Hcc_CO2_lab_temp_and_ionic_strength / ((vol_vial_ml - vol_l_ml)*1e-3)) #calculated moles CO2 in aqueous phase

### for confidence interval

samples_calibrated_summ <- samples_calibrated_summ %>% mutate(mol_CO2_g_95_confidence = pCO2_bar_95_confidence * (vol_vial_ml - vol_l_ml) * 1e-3 / (R * lab_temp_K)) # calculate moles CO2 in gas phase

# add column in which d13C is rounded to tenth of permil place
samples_calibrated_summ <- samples_calibrated_summ %>% mutate(`DIC_uM rounded ones` = round(DIC_uM, 0))

### clean and print
samples_select <- samples_calibrated_summ %>% select(name, n, `amp44_mean [mV] mean`, amp44_t0, pCO2_bar, pCO2_bar_95_confidence, DIC_uM, DIC_uM_95_confidence, `DIC_uM rounded ones`, quantitatable) 

samples_select %>% kable(caption = "DIC concentration from calibration of amp44 t0 vs. pCO2 expected")
```

Plot samples to check that their amplitude roughly makes sense given their calculated $c_{\sum\text{CO}_2}$. Note that on this plot, the standards' $c_{\sum\text{CO}_2}$ was calculated simply with the mass loaded, whereas the samples were calculated based on the pCO$_2$ calibration. The samples do plot as expected.

Dashed line = LOQ.

```{r amp44-DIC-sample-stnd-check}
LOQ_DIC_um <- as.numeric(samples_select %>% filter(name == "LOQ") %>% select(DIC_uM))

# $\delta^{13}$C calibrations

## Initial dataset checks, plots, and culling

First round of culling looks at standard deviations of the stable isotope values of the individual peaks (typically there are 10 peaks, prior to previous culling for bad injects), and uses that information to identify analytical outliers or samples with problems or too few peaks. Often the "cutoff" of outliers tends to be sd of 0.075 - 0.1 permil.

Make summary plots of reproducibility of isotopic values.

```{r plot-summary-reproducibility-d13C}
data <- data %>% filter(amp44_t0 >= S_A_LOQ) # filter for samples with signal greater than or equal LOQ for concentration

sd.hist <- data %>% ggplot(aes(x=d13C.sd, fill = amp44_t0)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=.01) +
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

sd.values <- data %>% filter(!is.na(d13C.sd)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=file_id, y=d13C.sd, label=id1, color = `amp44_mean [mV]`)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+
  scale_color_gradientn(colours = c("red", "blue", "blue"), values = c(0, 0.2, 1))

sd.v.amp44 <- data %>% filter(!is.na(d13C.sd)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=`amp44_mean [mV]`, y=d13C.sd, fill=factor(num.peaks), label=file_id)) +
  geom_point(size=3, shape=21)+
  theme_bw()+
  scale_fill_discrete(name="# peaks")

sd.hist
sd.values %>% ggplotly()
sd.v.amp44 %>% ggplotly()
```

Remove any data points that did not replicate within uncertainty for the individual peaks, redo plots - creates a "culled data" file that shows samples and standards that shouldn't be used. In this analysis, no samples needed to be culled.

```{r cull-bad-reproducibility-d13C}
d13C.sd.cutoff <- 0.35 # set a standard deviation on d13C measurements between peaks that you deem acceptable

culled.data <- subset(data, d13C.sd>d13C.sd.cutoff)  # subset data that don't meet the acceptability threshold for d13C standard deviation
wo.culled <- subset(data, d13C.sd<d13C.sd.cutoff) # subset data that do meet the threshold

#print
culled.data
```

Plot yields of  the standards, using interactive plots. Use this to cull more standards if need be, by looking for statistical outliers that coincide with yield problems. Note: LSVEC is LiCO$_3$, whereas the other standards are CaCO$_3$, so it is expected that LSVEC has a different ratio of amplitude to mass loaded. Thus, all plotted standards look fine in this analytical session. 

```{r plot-yields-d13C, fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
# make a data frame of standards
stds1 <- subset(wo.culled, type_general == "standard")

stds1 <- stds1 %>% mutate(standard = case_when(
  str_detect(id1, "YULE") == TRUE ~ "YULE",
  str_detect(id1, "HIS") == TRUE ~ "HIS",
  str_detect(id1, "LSVEC") == TRUE ~ "LSVEC"
))

yield.stds <- ggplot(stds1, aes(x = mass_loaded_ug, y = `amp44_mean [mV]`, label=file_id)) +
  stat_smooth(method="lm") +
  geom_point(aes(color=standard)) +
  theme_bw()

# note: LSVEC is LiCO3, not CaCO3, so it is expected to be above the yield of the other standards

d13C.stds <- 
  ggplot(stds1, aes(label=file_id)) +
  geom_point(shape=21, mapping = aes(x =`amp44_mean [mV]`, y = `d13C.measured [permil]`, fill = standard)) +
  facet_grid(standard ~ ., scales = "free") +
  theme_bw()

ggplotly(yield.stds)
ggplotly(d13C.stds )
```

```{r cull-d13C-stnds, fig.height=8, fig.width=10}

## Isotope standard values

### Load isotope standards

```{r load-isotope-stnds}
standards <- 
  tibble::tribble(
    ~name,           ~true_d13C,
    "HIS",			     -4.80,
    "LSVEC",			   -46.6,
    "YULE",		       -3.12
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    true_d13C = iso_double_with_units(true_d13C, "permil")
  )
standards %>% knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

### Add isotope standards
```{r add-isotope-stnds}
wo.culled_w_stds <- 
  wo.culled %>% 
  iso_add_standards(stds = standards, match_by = c(name)) 
```

## Generate a calibration with linear regression

```{r generate-calib-d13C}
calibs <- wo.culled_w_stds %>%
  # prepare for calibration
  iso_prepare_for_calibration() %>% 
  # run calibrations
  iso_generate_calibration(
    model = c(
      # reference scale correction
      delta_only = lm(`d13C.measured [permil]` ~ true_d13C),
      # multivariate with delta and amplitude
      delta_and_ampl = lm(`d13C.measured [permil]` ~ true_d13C + `amp44_mean [mV]`),
      # + the delta and amplitude cross term
      delta_cross_ampl = lm(`d13C.measured [permil]` ~ true_d13C * `amp44_mean [mV]`),
      # multivariate with delta and the datetime (i.e. checking for temporal drift)
      delta_and_time = lm(`d13C.measured [permil]` ~ true_d13C + file_datetime),
      delta_cross_time = lm(`d13C.measured [permil]` ~ true_d13C * file_datetime),
      # multivariate with delta, amplitude and datetime
      delta_and_ampl_and_time = lm(`d13C.measured [permil]` ~ true_d13C + `amp44_mean [mV]` + file_datetime),

    # specify which peaks to include in the calibration, here:
    # - all std_peaks (this filter should always be included!)
    use_in_calib = is_std_peak
  ) 
```

### Coefficients

```{r calib-coeffs, fig.width=7, fig.height=8}
# look at coefficients and summary
calibs %>% 
  # unnest calibration parameters
  iso_get_calibration_parameters(
    select_from_coefs =

      c(fit_R2 = adj.r.squared, fit_RMSD = deviance, residual_df = df.residual)) %>%
  arrange(term) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 4)
```

### Visualize Calibration Parameters

The visualization of the calibration parameters reveals that as expected the scale contraction and amplitude calibrations are highly statistically relevant (`***` = p.value < 0.001). DT (drift) is not statistically relevant.

```{r visualize-calib-params, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 11, message=FALSE}

## Apply global calibration
```{r apply-global-calib, cache=TRUE}

  # which calibration to use? can include multiple if desired to see the result
  # in this case, the amplitude- and time-conscious calibrations are applied

# Evaluation of isotope calibration

## Overview

One sample (NSHQ04) is slightly below the calibrated amplitude range, but its amplitude is still close to the several standard analyses, so it seems OK.

# and with a highlight of the calibration ranges and which points are in range

    # choose x and y (multiple y possible)

    # choose aesthetics
    color = in_range, shape = is_std_peak, size = 3,
    # decide what geoms to include
    points = TRUE
