# Supplementary Materials

This repository holds all supplementary source code needed to reproduce the calculations and plots of the research article “Geochemical, biological and clumped isotopologue evidence for substantial microbial methane production under carbon limitation in serpentinites of the Samail Ophiolite, Oman” by Daniel B. Nothaft, Alexis S. Templeton, Jeemin H. Rhim, David T. Wang, Jabrane Labidi, Hannah M. Miller, Eric S. Boyd, Juerg M. Matter, Shuhei Ono, Edward D. Young, Sebastian H. Kopf, Peter Kelemen, Mark E. Conrad, and The Oman Drilling Project Science Team. The article can be viewed on [ESSOAR](https://doi.org/10.1002/essoar.10504124.1).

The compiled analysis files are available as [HTML reports](https://danote.github.io/Oman_CH4_stable_isotopes/).

We hope that this code, or any part of it, might prove useful to other members of the scientific community interested in the subject matter. All code is completely open-access and can be modified and repurposed in every way. If significant portions are reused in a scientific publication, please consider citing our work. Please make sure to cite this work if re-using any of our data.

The code can be run on [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/danote/Oman_CH4_stable_isotopes/master)

However, we have that there are sometimes problems loading tidyverse package in this Binder, so apologies if it doesn't work for you.
